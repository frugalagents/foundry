New group — did not exist in the original architecture diagram. Added because
no existing group covers build-time quality gating; `ops/observability`
covers runtime tracing of live traffic, a distinct concern (see
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.3, gap audit item 5).

## Components

- [Agent Evals & Quality Harness](evals.md) — pre-deploy regression suites and
  quality gates for the platform being built. Written.
